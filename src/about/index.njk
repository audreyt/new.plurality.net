  <h1>About Plurality</h1>

  <p>
    <em>Plurality: The Future of Collaborative Technology and Democracy</em> is a book by Audrey Tang and E. Glen Weyl that explores how digital technology can be designed to recognize, honor, and bridge social differences rather than ignore or inflame them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drawing on principles from network science, mechanism design, and Taiwan's pioneering digital democracy experiments, the book presents a vision of technology that supports collaboration across diversity. It argues that the greatest potential of technology lies not in replacing human judgment with artificial intelligence, but in augmenting the collective intelligence of diverse communities.
